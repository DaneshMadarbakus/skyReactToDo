#SUMMARY

##APPROACH
My overall approach to this task was to follow a TDD pattern
First write the tests and then build functions to pass the test
However, as the task stated, my priority was to buid a working app

##IMPROVEMENTS 
If given more time for the test I would revise the unit tests to make sure they are complete and concise
